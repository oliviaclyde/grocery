This goal of this project is to get alerts (either text or email) when my favorite products go on sale at Smith's!

When I finish I will have learned how to:
- Create and host a simple web app
- Perform CRUD operations 
- Connect to a database  
- Implement automated testing of my code
- Ensure my app is secure
- Host the app
- Connect to an external API for pricing data
- Package using Docker for deployment
